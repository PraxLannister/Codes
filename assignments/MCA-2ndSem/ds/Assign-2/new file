Assignment -2
(Array)

Note: Always try to write menu driven program with proper comments in your code
1. Consider the elements of the array are given as {2 7 9 5 8 7 4}. Write a program in C to
find minimum number of swaps required to gather all elements less than or equals to k.




Input:  arr[] = {2, 1, 5, 6, 3}, k = 3
Output: 1

Explanation: 
To bring elements 2, 1, 3 together, swap 
element '5' with '3' such that final array
will be-
arr[] = {2, 1, 3, 6, 5}

Input:  arr[] = {2, 7, 9, 5, 8, 7, 4}, k = 5
Output: 2
 b

3. Write a program in C to merge two arrays of same size sorted in descending order.
4. Write a program in C to count the frequency of each element of an array.
5. Perform the following operations on 2-D Array.
I. Addidion
II. Substraction
III. Multiplication
IV. Transpose of a Given Matrix
6. Write a program in C to display the lower triangular and upper triangular matrix of given 3x3
matrix.
	7. Write a program in C to find two elements whose sum is closest to zero.(Elements of array
	can be negative no also).
8. Write a program in C to rearrange an array in such an order thatâ€“ smallest, largest, 2nd
